##   File Input and Output

In order to facilitate the operation of the file,COStream provides built-in composite support for file I/O.Programmers can easily read and write files by using the built-in file I/O composite.FileReader and FileWriter are built-in composite interface provided by COStream for I/O.FileReader can read data from file to data stream.FileWriter can writes data in the stream to the file.The specific usage is as follows:
```c++
stream<double x> A,B;
A = FileReader(“data.bin”);
B = FMRadioCore(A);
FileWriter(B)(“result.txt”);
```
The example indicates that the data in the data.bin file is read into the data stream A.Then FMRadioCore processes the data.In the end,FileWriter write the data to the file result.txt.By providing file storage for input and output,C++ program can provide data to dataflow program or use the output of dataflow program.
